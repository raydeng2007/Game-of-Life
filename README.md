Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton that was invented by British mathematician John Conway
in 1970, this '0 player game' imitates the idea of cell repopulating over a period of time. To learn 
more, here's a link to the wiki page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life 

Each blue cell represents a living cell and each gray cell represents a dead cell. Each cell on the board
follows a specific set of rules: 
1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.

2) Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

3) Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

You can also pre-populate the board with existing patterns in the _Seed Style_ section of the menu.
